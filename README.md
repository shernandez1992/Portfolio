# Portfolio

These four projects show different aspects of my 
ability to clean, explore, manipulate, and visualize
data with SQL, Python, and Python libraries.

## Covid Data Exploration

This project explores and queries global Covid-19
death and vaccination data in SQL.

The project makes use of joins, CTE's, 
window functions, aggregate functions, 
view creation, and data type conversions in PostgreSQL.

Due to the large file size of the csv files
used in the project exceeding github's 
25MB file upload size, a link to the website 
where the data was downloaded from is in the
project subfolder's README file.
